# cryptist-app
This is an app for a course project (AC215). This app contains two components: Forecast and Trading-agent.

A user can choose an asset (for now, that's gonna be either Bitcoin or Ethereum).
The Forecast component will display the forecast price of the asset based on pretrained deep learning models. Below is an illustration of the Forecast component:

The Trading-agent component (have not deployed yet, but it can be deployed just as the Forecast component) will simulate a AI trading agent (trained with deep reinforcement learning) and display the performence of the trading agent (a time series of the total assets or the P&L)
